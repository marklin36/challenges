# Tagup Data Science Exercise

## Getting Started

You will need the following programs available:

- git
- python3
- conda ([download/install conda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/))

Once these are properly installed and configured, you are ready to begin.  First, you will need to fork this repository, then,
1. run `conda create -n dschallenge python=3.6.9 numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn matplotlib pytest ipython jupyter`
2. run `conda activate dschallenge`
3. execute `jupyter notebook`
This will open a browser tab to the jupyter interface. Open the data science exercise notebook, and follow the instructions it contains. Those instructions are repeated below for convenience.

## The Exercise

ExampleCo, Inc is gathering several types of data for its fleet of very expensive machines.  These very expensive machines have three operating modes: *normal*, *faulty* and *failed*.   The machines run all the time, and usually they are in normal mode.  However, in the event that the machine enters faulty mode, the company would like to be aware of this as soon as possible.  This way they can take preventative action to avoid entering failed mode and hopefully save themselves lots of money.

They collect four kinds of timeseries data for each machine in their fleet of very expensive machines.  When a machine is operating in *normal* mode the data behaves in a fairly predictable way, but with a moderate amount of noise.  Before a machine fails it will ramp into *faulty* mode, during which the data appears visibly quite different.  Finally, when a machine fails it enters a third, and distinctly different, *failed* mode where all signals are very close to 0.

__Your main objective: to develop an automated method to pinpoint the times of fault and failure in this machine__.  Keep in mind that you will be sharing these results with the executives at ExampleCo, so to the best of your ability, try to explain what you are doing, what you've shown, and why you think your predictions are good.


A few notes to help:
1. A good place to start is by addressing the noise due to communication
   errors.
2. Feel free to use any libraries you like, or even other programming
   languages. Your final results should be presented in this notebook, however.
3. There are no constraints on the techniques you bring to bear, we are curious
   to see how you think and what sort of resources you have in your toolbox.
4. Be sure to clearly articulate what you did, why you did it, and how the
   results should be interpreted. In particular you should be aware of the
   limitations of whatever approach or approaches you take.
5. Don't feel compelled to use all the data if you're not sure how. Feel free
   to focus on data from a single unit if that makes it easier to get started.
6. Don't hesitate to reach out to datasciencejobs@tagup.io with any questions!
